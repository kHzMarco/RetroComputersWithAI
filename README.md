# RetroComputersWithAI
Giving wisdom to retro computers

## Introduction

AI tools enable the user to have super powerrs in terms of wisdom.
For example, if the user does not know which are the commands to perform a partitioning to a hard disk, the AI can assist the user, provide the correct commands, plus giving explanation about all the involved steps.

The idea is to somehow provide retrocomputers (e.g. MS-DOS, windows 98) access to a modern AI tools

## Constraints

Technological limitations make virtually impossible to just plug an ethernet cable and open AI tools from the browser, because of dozens of reasons. From low level protocol, to CPU resources, etc.

## Posibilities

:) Fortunely, there are a set of tools that can help to achieve ths mission.

Old computers have:
RS232, or USB, software like hyperterminal.

Raspberry Pi has, USB, ethernet/wifi, modern linux. internet connectivity etc.

## Main concept

Old PC > RS232 > USB to RS232 > RaspberryPi > Internet > AI tool.
